========= STAGE ALPHA =========
In the first stage, let's declare the relationship between the Sun and Planets. Suns should have many planets. And planets should belong to a sun

Run options: include {:stage=>:alpha}

Planet
  orbits a single sun

Sun
  is circled by many planets

Finished in 0.01184 seconds (files took 1.66 seconds to load)
2 examples, 0 failures


========= STAGE BETA =========
Next up, planets have many moons and moons belong to a planet.

Run options: include {:stage=>:beta}

Moon
  circles a single planet

Planet
  is circled by many moons

Finished in 0.0172 seconds (files took 1.68 seconds to load)
2 examples, 0 failures


========= STAGE GAMMA =========
Let's implement a basic many-to-many connection between planets and asteroids.

Run options: include {:stage=>:gamma}

Asteroid
  circles many planets (FAILED - 1)

Planet
  is circled by many asteroids (FAILED - 2)

Failures:

  1) Asteroid circles many planets
     Failure/Error: expect(subject).to have_many(:planets)
       Expected Asteroid to have a has_many association called planets (no association called planets)
     # ./spec/models/asteroid_spec.rb:6:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

  2) Planet is circled by many asteroids
     Failure/Error: expect(subject).to have_many(:asteroids)
       Expected Planet to have a has_many association called asteroids (no association called asteroids)
     # ./spec/models/planet_spec.rb:14:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.01927 seconds (files took 1.63 seconds to load)
2 examples, 2 failures

Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/models/asteroid_spec.rb:5 # Asteroid circles many planets
rspec ./spec/models/planet_spec.rb:13 # Planet is circled by many asteroids
